 swift protocol oriented programming tutorials

Why protocols
- Protocol serve as better abstraction than classes
- Modeling a system with classes implies inheritance
- Inheritance is great - until it's not: 
  - Bloaded superclass 
  - Not support for value types
  
  Protocols: 
  - Any type can conform to multiple protocols
  - Promote granular design
  - Can be addopted by reference and value types
